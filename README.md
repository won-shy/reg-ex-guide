## Description

Regular expressions also known as regex are a series of special characters that define a search pattern and validate specific strings. This is a tutorial to show how the regular expression /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ is used to validate email addresses. It checks whether a string follows a specific pattern to form a valid email address.
